# Optimizing Recruitment Methods for Vulnerable Patients

## Project Overview 
In this project, I am examining the effectiveness of our patient recruitment methods. I compare the successful return rate from mailings vs phone calls. I examine the phone call response rates by hour of day and day of week. I then filter patients by their Social Vulnerability Index to assess how their phone call response rates differ. My goal is to deliver actionable insight on how to improve response rates among patients in more vulnerable populations. 

 ## What's in this Repository? 
This repository contains scripts and notebooks which demonstrate the analytical pipeline for this research project. The Geocoding script shows the geocoding and merging process, which I performed using the ArcPy package from ArcGIS Pro software. The Data Prep notebook shows the wrangling, cleaning, and merging of various healthcare data sources (REDCap, Clarity data tables, Excel spreadsheets, etc.). The Exploratory Data Analysis notebook shows the filtering, analysis, and visualization of the resulting data. 

## Data Plots
The manuscript for this project is in progress. In the meantime, I am including screenshots of the relevant plots below. Explanation and statistical analyses will be provided in the full paper.
