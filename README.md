# Assessing Effectiveness of Telephone Outreach

## Project Overview 
In this project, I examine how telephone outreach affects the recruitment of underrepresented patients. I compare demographics and Social Vulnerability Index between patients recruited without telephone outreach and with telephone outreach. I also examine the response rates to telephone outreach by time of day and day of week. 

 ## What's in this Repository? 
This repository contains a data preparation, geocoding, and data exploration notebook. The data preparation notebook shows the wrangling, cleaning, and merging of various healthcare data sources (REDCap, Clarity data tables, Excel spreadsheets, etc.). The geocoding script shows the geocoding and merging process, which I performed using the ArcPy package from ArcGIS Pro software. The data exploration notebook shows the analysis and visualization of the data. 

## Figures, Plots, and Tables
